# Zwitter - Twitter Clone

### Used Technologies
 * Svelte (Frontend)
	- Svelte is an easy to use JavaScript framework which compiles to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thus making it fast and lightweight, while still being very powerful.
 * FastAPI (Backend)
	- FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
 * Redis (Caching)
	- Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory key-value store, used as a database, cache and message broker. In-memory means that the data is stored in RAM, thus making it very fast despite large amounts of data. Data is still persisted to disk, but only every 5 minutes.
